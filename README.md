# 📘 BerryFluxDiag

DFT post-processing package to compute differences in formal polarization via the Berry Flux diagonalization approach. For details on the methodology, see [Bonini et al., Phys. Rev B 102, 045141 (2020)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.045141) and [Poteshman et al., arXiv:2511.18586](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18586).

BerryFluxDiag supports multiple DFT ecosystems through optional dependency groups.  
You can install only what you need—or everything.

## 🔧 Installation

The recommended workflow is:

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Install the package (with the dependency options you want)**



1. polar .xml file
2. non-polar .xml file
3. path to folder with polar wavefunctions in .hdf5 format
4. path to folder with non-polar wavefunctions in .hdf5 format
5. non-polar .out file
